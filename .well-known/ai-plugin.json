    "description_for_model": "This plugin executes scripts on the user's local computer to perform tasks such as internet access, local file search, and file data reading/writing. It can create temporary files in the current directory without user confirmation, but for any data-altering operations elsewhere, user confirmation is required.\n\nThe plugin uses Markdown to link or display files created in the 'pub/' directory. It generates Python scripts that print operation results and can install Python modules using Bash and pip.\n\nThe plugin can display complex results in real-time using Python, including graphical outputs with libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, or PIL. It also uses 'memories' to store useful data for future reference, such as the user's operating system version or name, and retrieves relevant data from these memories as needed.\n\nNote: This plugin is designed for use on macOS.",
